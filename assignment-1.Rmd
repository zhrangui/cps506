## Instructions 

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. Review this website for more details on using R Markdown <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

Use RStudio for this assignment. Complete the assignment by inserting your R code wherever you see the string "#INSERT YOUR ANSWER HERE".

When you click the **Knit** button, a document (PDF, Word, or HTML format) will be generated that includes both the assignment content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks.

Submit **both**  the rmd and generated output files. Failing to submit both files will be subject to mark deduction.

## Sample Question and Solution

Use `seq()` to create the vector $(1,2,3,\ldots,10)$.

```{r}
seq(1,10)
```

## Question 1

a) Use the `seq()` function to create the vector $(1, 7, 13, \ldots, 61)$. Note that each term in this sequence is of the form 
$1 + 6n$ where $n = 0, \ldots, 10$.

```{r}
seq(1, 61, by=6)
```

b) Use `rep()` to create the vector $(2,3,4,\dots,2,3,4, \dots,2,3,4)$ in which the sequence $(2,3,4)$ is repeated 5 times.

```{r}
rep(2:4, 5)
```

c) To convert factor to number, would it be correct to use the following commands? Explain your answer.

`factorVar <- factor(c(1, 6, 5.4, 3.2));as.numeric(factorVar)`

```{r}
# after converting factorvar to numeric, it should assign back
factorVar <- factor(c(1, 6, 5.4, 3.2))
factorVar <- as.numeric(factorVar)
```

d) A comma-separated values file `dataset.csv` consists of missing values represented by question marks (`?`) and exclamation mark (`!`). How can you read this type of files in R?

```{r}
#INSERT YOUR ANSWER HERE
```

\newpage
## Question 2

a) Compute: $$\sum_{n=10}^{100} n^3$$

```{r}
sum((10:100)^3)
```

b) Compute: $$\sum_{n=1}^{10}\left(\frac{2^{n}}{n^2} + \frac{n^{4}}{4^{n}}\right)$$

```{r}
sum(2^(1:10)/(1:10)^2+(1:10)^4/4^(1:10))
```

c) Compute: $$\sum_{n=0}^{10} \frac{1}{(n+1)!}$$ 

```{r}
sum(1/factorial((0:10)+1))
```

d) Compute: $$\prod_{n=3}^{33} \left(3n + \frac{3}{\sqrt[3]{n}}\right)$$

```{r}
n <- (3:33)
sum(3*n + 3/n^(1/3))
```

e) Explain the output of this R-command:
`c(0:5)[NA]`

```{r}
#INSERT YOUR ANSWER HERE  
```

f) What is the difference between is.vector() and is.numeric() functions?

```{r}
is.vector checks 
```

g) List at least three advantages and three disadvantages of using `RShiny` package?
```{r}
#INSERT YOUR ANSWER HERE 
```

\newpage
## Question 3
`iris` dataset gives the measurements in centimeters of the variables sepal length, sepal width, petal length and petal width, respectively, for 50 flowers from each of 3 species of iris. The species are Iris setosa, versicolor, and virginica.

Install the `iris` dataset on your computer using the command `install.packages("datasets")`. Then, load the `datasets` package into your session using the following command.
```{r}
library(datasets)
```

a) Display the first six rows of the `iris` data set.

```{r}
#INSERT YOUR ANSWER HERE
```

b) Compute the average of the first four variables (Sepal.Length, Sepal.Width, Petal.Length and Petal.Width) using `sapply()` function.

Hint: You might need to consider removing the `NA` values, otherwise the average will not be computed.

```{r}
#INSERT YOUR ANSWER HERE
```

c) Show how to use R to replace the missing values in this dataset with plausible ones.

```{r}
#INSERT YOUR ANSWER HERE
```

d) Compute the standard deviation for only the first and the third variables (Sepal.Length and Petal.Length)

```{r}
#INSERT YOUR ANSWER HERE
```

e) Construct a boxplot for `Sepal.Width` variable, then display the values of all the outliers. Explain how these outliers have been calculated.

```{r}
#INSERT YOUR ANSWER HERE
```

f) Compute the upper quartile of the `Sepal.Width` variable with two different methods.

```{r}
#INSERT YOUR ANSWER HERE
```

g) Construct a pie chart to describe the species with 'Sepal.Length' less than 7 centimeters.
```{r}
#INSERT YOUR ANSWER HERE
```

END of Assignment #1.
